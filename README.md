# Demo2Video-modder
Automatic mod merge for the Demo2Video project

### This requires existing installation of Demo2Video!
### Options, if you don't have it installed
1. Easiest way
   * Install D2V using [MoonÂ²s fork](https://github.com/m0onmo0n/Demo2Video-Installer) of auto installer
   * Use modder to aplly forked edits

2. Direct way
   * Install modded D2V manually using [my fork](https://github.com/OeschMe/Demo2Video-oeschme

3. Manual way (the hard way)
   * Install vanilla D2V manually using [Nortons repo](https://github.com/norton62/Demo2Video)
   * Use modder to aplly forked edits

Script will take timestamped backups of the files and fetch the modded/new files automatically.

<sup><sub>Script still misses error handling, but it should work as is from proper D2V project folder.</sub></sup>
